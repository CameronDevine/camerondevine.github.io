					Greetings from Tamara and Cameron, in Seattle Washington. Thanks so much for being a special part of our year. This year sure has been busy, hasn't it?
				</p><p>
					This December marks one year of being in the apartment off Lake City Way, where Tamara and Cameron are now living with their three cats: Sammy, Sassy, and Khing. Tamara was the first to move in after Thanksgiving, followed by Sammy and Sassy. Cameron moved in during the first week of December so that way we were all there to welcome Khing home as he returned from Thailand. It was quite the adventure getting the cats to all get along-almost as much as an adventure to get all the furniture to fit in the apartment!

					This September, Cameron started his second year of his Mechanical Engineering Master's degree at the University of Washington Seattle. He is on track to graduate in June, and then continue at UW for his PhD. Cameron has been a Research Assistant for the Boeing Advance Research Center at UW for the past year now, and is considering potential project he could do with the BARC lab for his Doctorate. Something that he is very interested in is robotics. His future aspirations still point toward being a professor at a university, but we will see what the future has in store.

	Tamara started her first year of graduate school this September at the University of Washington, Bothell, gaining a Master's in Educational Studies. She applied for the PhD program at UW Seattle for a doctorate in Literature for next fall, and should be hearing back in the spring time. Tamara is on track to graduate in June as well. Tamara also recently started working a few new jobs. Along with nannying a couple of times a week, she also was hired on as the Graduate Assistant at the University of Washington Bothell's Alumni office and has been the Nursery room lead at Overlake Park Presbyterian church for almost a year now.

					This year, Tamara and Cameron were blessed to go on many trips. Cameron's favorite trip was "the grandparents extravaganza". This trip occurred during spring break, in March. During this trip, we traveled to Indiana for Granddad Devine's 90 th birthday party. There were waterslides, family, and lots of cupcakes decorated with marzipan-it was a blast! Then, we ventured to Maine, where we visited Tamara's Nana's home. While visiting with Nana Ramsay and Uncle Peter, we toured around Maine and ate all the local foods. The following day, we drove from Maine to New York City, where we visited all the cites, including the Twin Tower Memorial, the One World Trade Center, Central Park, Trump Tower, Tiffany's, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station and more! The next day, we flew out, back to Washington to go to Granddad Hoke's 90 th birthday party at Copalis Beach. The fun continued as we dug a dam, walked the beach and played plenty of board games. This was a trip we will never forget.

					Tamara's favorite trip this year was one that she took solo. With the early birth of her sweet little nephew in October, Tamara knew that she needed to visit as soon as possible. She flew to Ohio over the Veteran's day weekend to visit her very best friend, and honorary sister, Christina (Neena) and her husband Darren. Neena's mom and little sister were on this journey as well, and luckily enough, they had the same flight to Ohio as Tamara. They spent a lot of the weekend in the hospital, visiting little baby E. For Tamara, it was the most perfect trip she could ever think of. Not only did she get to spend four copious days with her best friend, but also with the most beautiful baby she has ever seen. This trip also consisted of ample amounts of varying foods. Neena and Tam's favorite thing- next to baby E, that is.

					Cameron and Tamara remain very involved with both family, church and community events. Most holidays have been spent with numerous family members. In this, they have attempted to attend every family event offered. As for church, Tamara is the head of the nursery room and had upward to seven students every Sunday. Recently, Cameron has been assisting with the sound booth. Cameron is still participating in orienteering whenever he can, too, slowly working on bettering his speed. Meanwhile, every weekend, Tamara visits her Grandma Del for good hugs and chats. We don't have much room in our small apartment, but we love visitors nonetheless. We hope to see you soon, and that you have a spectacular holiday season!
